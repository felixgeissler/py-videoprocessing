# py-videoprocessing

A simple Python v.2.7 script processing a live captured video signal including color conversions, resampling and filtering.

## Getting started

Starting the script is fairly simple. Just make sure you have all the neccessary libarys installed:
```
python main.py
```

You can also toggle the debug mode which will display all the outputs after each processing step via:
```
python main.py --debug
```

## Note

Using a pyramidal filter throws me some errors recently. Feel free to fix a few commentet lines and send me a pull request on GitHub.
